# JavaMBX
Super Mario Bros. X remade in Java!

This is the official repository for JavaMBX, the Java remake of Super Mario Bros. X.

# What will it contain?

It will contain improved physics, more integration, LunaLUA, more features, online gameplay, high quality audio, more enemies, configurations, a snazzy new loader and title screen, and most of all, it will be smaller than the original!

# Why JavaMBX?

It all started on the SMBX Forums when I was thinking about recreating SMBX in Lua or Python.  But then, Luigifan2010 suggested that I use Java instead.  Now, here I am recreating SMBX in Java.

# Is there any way I can contribute?

Yes there is!  You can help me research SMBX physics, do pull requests, test it out, even fork the project!

# How can I learn Java?

No problem!  You can check the Java Tutorials at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/index.html right away.

# Where can I find out more about SMBX?

That's what I come for!  All the information about SMBX is at http://www.supermariobros.org/wiki/.

# Oh no!  A bug!

Well, there might be bugs in the project, but, not to worry!  You can report them in the Report Issues section!
